## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need a local server environment that supports PHP and MySQL, such as:
* [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
* [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)
* [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME].git
    ```

2.  **Move to your server directory:**
    Place the cloned project folder inside the `htdocs` (for XAMPP) or `www` (for WAMP/MAMP) directory.

3.  **Set up the Database:**
    * Start your Apache and MySQL services from your server control panel.
    * Open phpMyAdmin (e.g., navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
    * Create a new database and name it `database-damkar`.
    * Select the new database and go to the **"Import"** tab.
    * Click "Choose File" and select the `database-damkar.sql` file included in this project.
    * Click "Go" to import the tables and data.

4.  **Configure the Database Connection:**
    * Open the database configuration file located at `src/config/db-config.php`.
    * Verify that the credentials (`$hostname`, `$username`, `$password`, `$database`) match your local MySQL setup. The default is usually correct for a standard XAMPP installation.
    ```php
    $hostname = "localhost";
    $username = "root";
    $password = "";
    $database = "database-damkar";
    ```

5.  **Run the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/WEBSITE-DAMKAR-DEPOK/public/home.html`.
